# webdevelopmentproject
This is my source code for my Web Development module project.

The purpose of this module was to get hands-on experience with a broad variety of web development technologies. We touched upon:

HTML5
CSS
JavaScript (and jQuery)
PHP
phpMyAdmin (along with MySQL)

I also created an API for communication between my web app and my database.
