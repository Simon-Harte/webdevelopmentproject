318,"I thought to give 5 stars the reason that I gave 4 stars is there was multiplayer in this game.",4
288,"Normally I would moan because it is just a reskin of Subway Surfers and Talking Tom Gold Run but this game is so different. The main mode is where you do tons of missions to unlock cool stuff! (By the way the game is inspired by the series: Super Noms on YouTube.) Overall the game is fun!!",5

1738,I really like this game. More then I thought I would. Edit: I've been doing the missions and the game keeps glitching out. The screen will distort & it'll either go black or exit itself. I've noticed it mostly happens when the snakes appear.,5
1627,I find this game to be one of my favorite mobile games. The fact you can unlock different masks that increase the randomized amount of coins and the frequency of boosters in an endless arcade mode adds more to the game. The only complaints I have about this game are the fact you use a shield when yo...,4

1949,The game itself is fun and my 2.5 year old loves playing it. The only thing keeping it from 5* is that it is a little difficult at times to figure out what action comes next.,4
451,Yeah this game is trash why because when it your first time playing there should be a hand or person in the game showing you how to play the game all round then you would be left alone to play the game and have fun,1
